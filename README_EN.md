Local Network Loopback Manager for Windows 11

[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README.md)

</div>

---

`Loopback Manager` is a small tool to manage the local network loopback of all applications on the current device

## ‚ùìWhat's this?

You may be unfamiliar with the local network loopback, but you may be more familiar with `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, which is the local loopback address.

For many users, setting up a network proxy is a very common operation, and you may not even realize it yourself. Most of the proxies are local proxies, but in many cases, even if you use proxies in the system, some applications still cannot connect to the network. This is because these applications do not enable the local network loopback function.

**Especially for UWP applications, the default is to turn off network loopback**„ÄÇ

This tool is used to handle this matter, open it, check all the applications you want to enable the local network loopback, click **Save**, these applications can go to the local proxy, the operation is very convenient.
